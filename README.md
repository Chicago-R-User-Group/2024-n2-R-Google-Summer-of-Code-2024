# R Google Summer of Code 2024

Come join us to learn about the R Project for Statistical Computing's participation in the upcoming Google Summer of Code (R-GSoC)!

This is also an excellent forum for interested candidates to attend and ask questions about project contributions and how to apply to R-GSoC. Two of the R-GSoC program administrators, Toby Hocking and Brian Peterson, will introduce the program and highlight some specific program projects such as the venerable data.table. We may also hear from past contributors!

R-GSoC has been a Mentor Organization for 19 consecutive years with CRUG members involved from the very beginning. We note that some very successful R programmers got started contributing to a GSoC project or package, and gained some valuable programming skills during the process. More information on GSoC can be found at <- https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/.

The contributor application period is from March 18 - April 2nd @ 18:00UTC. You can certainly start working on your proposal now and reach out to organization admins/mentors for feedback. Here's a useful guide for applications <- https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice

We are excited for the R-GSoC event and hopefully we get the opportunity to work with some of you this summer!

A Berkeley-educated California native, Toby Dylan Hocking received his PhD in mathematics (machine learning) from Ecole Normale Superiere de Cachan (Paris, France) in 2012. He worked as a postdoc in Masashi Sugiyama's machine learning lab at Tokyo Tech in 2013, and in Guillaume Bourque's genomics lab in McGill University, Montreal, Canada (2014-2018). Since 2018 he is Assistant Professor at Northern Arizona University, where he directs the Machine Learning Research Lab. He has authored dozens of R packages, and has published 50+ peer-reviewed research papers on machine learning and statistical software. He has mentored 30+ students in research projects, as well as another 30+ open-source software contributors with R Project in Google Summer of Code.

and Brian Peterson

Brian Peterson acts as an organization administrator for R's participation in the prestigious annual Google Summer of Code program. He has more than two decades of experience researching, designing, developing, and deploying production quantitative trading systems. He has been the lead executive for quantitative trading in multiple Chicago proprietary trading firms where his personal assets have been at risk every day. Brian is co-author or maintainer of over 10 packages for using the R statistical language in finance. In addition, Brian has continued to research, publish, and teach. Brian has deep experience delivering large, technically complex production systems utilizing the latest technologies and techniques, including advanced optimization, machine learning and artificial intelligence, low latency execution, and algorithm design, judged directly by their performance in live markets.
